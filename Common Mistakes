1. 
Error: Could not open file `/dev/i2c-1': Permission denied
Run as root?
A: use sudo 

2. saying library doesn't exist even though i have it installed (like ADAfruitBBIO_): use python3 instead of python
3.  "Permission Denied": chmod 755 grants read, write, execute permissions
4. For Shell scripts: we need to mark them as executable using chmod 755; use ./ to run the script if in current directory 
5. Error: Write Failed -- typically an error with wiring
