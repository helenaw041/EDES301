<h1>Digital Clock Buddy<\h1>
A desk clock that tells you the time and date, temperature, and conditions outside. There will be a button that can toggle between the 4 US time zones with LED indicators.  I will also have additional buttons for the user to manually update the display (default will be every 15 seconds for time and date and on press for temperature and weather conditions).
